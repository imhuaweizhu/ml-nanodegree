## Software eingieering practices

###### Production code: software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience. 

###### Production quality code: code that meets expectations in reliability, efficiency, etc., for production.

### Always write clean and modular code

#### Two General Rules

###### 1. Clean: readable, simple and consise (for collaboration and maintainability).
###### 2. Modular: logically broken up into functions and modules (for reusablity and efficiency).

#### Refactoring Code

###### It isn't easy to write your best code while you're still trying to just get it working. 

###### So we need to go back, clean and modularize your program after you've got the coding task working. 

###### Restructure your code to improve its internal structure, without changing its external functionality.

#### Rule #1. Write clean code

###### Reference the style guideline for your choice of language. 
###### C++: Code style and coding guidelines https://named-data.net/doc/ndn-cpp-dev/0.4.0/code-style.html
###### Python: PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?#code-lay-out

##### (1). Use meaningful names

###### (a). Be descriptive and imply type. Long names != descriptive names. For example: verbs for functions and nouns for variables, is_ or has_ for booleans

###### (b). Be consistent but clearly differentiate. For example: age_list and age is easier to differentiate than ages and age.

###### (c). Avoid abbreviations unless the phrase will be used a lot in the program

##### (2). Use whitespace properly
###### (a). Organize your code with consistent indentation. For example: the standard is to use 4 spaces for each indent.
###### (b). Separate sections with blank lines to keep your code well organized and readable.
###### (c). Try to limit your lines to around 79 words/characters including comments.
###### (d). Refer the style guideline for your language. For example: http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-philosophy

#### Rule #2. Write modular code
